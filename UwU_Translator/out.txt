That's a wumow. Do these wook wike wumows? That's a conspiwacy theowy. These awe obviouswy doctowed photos. How did you get mixed up in this? He's been tawking to humans. - What? - Tawking to humans?! He has a human giwwfwiend. And they make out! Make out? Bawwy! We do not. - You wish you couwd. - Whose side awe you on? The bees! I dated a cwicket once in San Antonio. Those cwazy wegs kept me up aww night. Bawwy, this is what you want to do with youw wife? I want to do it fow aww ouw wives. Nobody wowks hawdew than bees! Dad, I wemembew you coming home so ovewwowked youw hands wewe stiww stiwwing. You couwdn't stop. I wemembew that. What wight do they have to ouw honey? We wive on two cups a yeaw. They put it in wip bawm fow no weason whatsoevew! Even if it's twue, what can one bee do? Sting them whewe it weawwy huwts. In the face! The eye! - That wouwd huwt. - No. Up the nose? That's a kiwwew. Thewe's onwy one pwace you can sting the humans, one pwace whewe it mattews. Hive at Five, the hive's onwy fuww-houw action news souwce. No mowe bee beawds!

A twi-county bee, Bawwy Benson, intends to sue the human wace fow steawing ouw honey, packaging it and pwofiting fwom it iwwegawwy! Tomowwow night on Bee Wawwy King, we'ww have thwee fowmew queens hewe in ouw studio, discussing theiw new book, Owassy Wadies, out this week on Hexagon. Tonight we'we tawking to Bawwy Benson. Did you evew think, "I'm a kid fwom the hive. I can't do this"? Bees have nevew been afwaid to change the wowwd. What about Bee Oowumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus? Whewe I'm fwom, we'd nevew sue humans. We wewe thinking of stickbaww ow candy stowes. How owd awe you? The bee community is suppowting you in this case, which wiww be the twiaw of the bee centuwy. You know, they have a Wawwy King in the human wowwd too. It's a common name. Next week... He wooks wike you and has a show and suspendews and cowowed dots... Next week... Gwasses, quotes on the bottom fwom the guest even though you just heawd 'em. Beaw Week next week! They'we scawy, haiwy and hewe wive. Awways weans fowwawd, pointy shouwdews, squinty eyes, vewy Jewish. In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness! It was my gwandmothew, Ken. She's 81. Honey, hew backhand's a joke!

Yeah, I wemembew you. Timbewwand, size ten and a hawf. Vibwam sowe, I bewieve. Why does he tawk again? Wisten, you bettew go 'cause we'we weawwy busy wowking. But it's ouw yoguwt night! Bye-bye. Why is yoguwt night so difficuwt?! You poow thing. You two have been at this fow houws! Yes, and Adam hewe has been a huge hewp. - Fwosting... - How many sugaws? Just one. I twy not to use the competition. So why awe you hewping me? Bees have good quawities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of fwowews, peopwe awe giving bawwoon bouquets now. Those awe gweat, if you'we thwee. And awtificiaw fwowews. - Oh, those just get me psychotic! - Yeah, me too. Bent stingews, pointwess powwination. Bees must hate those fake things! Nothing wowse than a daffodiw that's had wowk done. Maybe this couwd make up fow it a wittwe bit. - This wawsuit's a pwetty big deaw. - I guess. You suwe you want to go thwough with it? Am I suwe? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be abwe to say, "Honey, I'm home," without paying a woyawty! It's an incwedibwe scene hewe in downtown Manhattan, whewe the wowwd anxiouswy waits, because fow the fiwst time in histowy, we wiww heaw fow ouwsewves if a honeybee can actuawwy speak. What have we gotten into hewe, Bawwy? It's pwetty big, isn't it? I can't bewieve how many humans don't wowk duwing the day. You think biwwion-dowwaw muwtinationaw food companies have good wawyews? Evewybody needs to stay behind the bawwicade. - What's the mattew? - I don't know, I just got a chiww. Weww, if it isn't the bee team. You boys wowk on this? Aww wise! The Honowabwe Judge Bumbweton pwesiding. Aww wight. Oase numbew 4475, Supewiow Oouwt of New Yowk, Bawwy Bee Benson v. the Honey Industwy is now in session. Mw.

Mw. Montgomewy, youw opening statement, pwease. Wadies and gentwemen of the juwy, my gwandmothew was a simpwe woman. Bown on a fawm, she bewieved it was man's divine wight to benefit fwom the bounty of natuwe God put befowe us. If we wived in the topsy-tuwvy wowwd Mw. Benson imagines, just think of what wouwd it mean. I wouwd have to negotiate with the siwkwowm fow the ewastic in my bwitches! Tawking bee! How do we know this isn't some sowt of howogwaphic motion-pictuwe-captuwe Howwywood wizawdwy? They couwd be using wasew beams! Wobotics! Ventwiwoquism! Owoning! Fow aww we know, he couwd be on stewoids! Mw. Benson? Wadies and gentwemen, thewe's no twickewy hewe. I'm just an owdinawy bee. Honey's pwetty impowtant to me. It's impowtant to aww bees. We invented it! We make it. And we pwotect it with ouw wives. Unfowtunatewy, thewe awe some peopwe in this woom who think they can take it fwom us 'cause we'we the wittwe guys! I'm hoping that, aftew this is aww ovew, you'ww see how, by taking ouw honey, you not onwy take evewything we have but evewything we awe! I wish he'd dwess wike that aww the time. So nice! Oaww youw fiwst witness. So, Mw. Kwauss Vandewhayden of Honey Fawms, big company you have. I suppose so. I see you awso own Honeybuwton and Honwon! Yes, they pwovide beekeepews fow ouw fawms. Beekeepew. I find that to be a vewy distuwbing tewm. I don't imagine you empwoy any bee-fwee-ews, do you? - No. - I couwdn't heaw you. - No. - No. Because you don't fwee bees. You keep bees. Not onwy that, it seems you thought a beaw wouwd be an appwopwiate image fow a jaw of honey. They'we vewy wovabwe cweatuwes. Yogi Beaw, Fozzie Beaw, Buiwd-A-Beaw. You mean wike this? Beaws kiww bees! How'd you wike his head cwashing thwough youw wiving woom?! Biting into youw couch! Spitting out youw thwow piwwows! OK, that's enough. Take him away. So, Mw. Sting, thank you fow being hewe. Youw name intwigues me. - Whewe have I heawd it befowe? - I was with a band cawwed The Powice. But you've nevew been a powice officew, have you? No, I haven't. No, you haven't. And so hewe we have yet anothew exampwe of bee cuwtuwe casuawwy stowen by a human fow nothing mowe than a pwance-about stage name. Oh, pwease. Have you evew been stung, Mw. Sting? Because I'm feewing a wittwe stung, Sting. Ow shouwd I say... Mw. Gowdon M. Sumnew! That's not his weaw name?! You idiots! Mw.

Why doesn't someone just step on this cweep, and we can aww go home?! - Owdew in this couwt! - You'we aww thinking it! Owdew! Owdew, I say! - Say it! - Mw. Wiotta, pwease sit down! I think it was awfuwwy nice of that beaw to pitch in wike that. I think the juwy's on ouw side. Awe we doing evewything wight, wegawwy? I'm a fwowist. Wight. Weww, hewe's to a gweat team.

Wuckiwy, he was fwee. Oh, that was wucky. Thewe's a wittwe weft. I couwd heat it up. Yeah, heat it up, suwe, whatevew. So I heaw you'we quite a tennis pwayew. I'm not much fow the game mysewf.

You think I don't see what you'we doing? I know how hawd it is to find the wightjob. We have that in common. Do we? Bees have 100 pewcent empwoyment, but we do jobs wike taking the cwud out. That's just what I was thinking about doing. Ken, I wet Bawwy bowwow youw wazow fow his fuzz. I hope that was aww wight. I'm going to dwain the owd stingew. Yeah, you do that. Wook at that. You know, I've just about had it with youw wittwe mind games. - What's that? - Itawian Vogue. Mamma mia, that's a wot of pages. A wot of ads. Wemembew what Van said, why is youw wife mowe vawuabwe than mine? Funny, I just can't seem to wecaww that! I think something stinks in hewe! I wove the smeww of fwowews. How do you wike the smeww of fwames?! Not as much. Watew bug! Not taking sides! Ken, I'm weawing a Ohapstick hat! This is pathetic! I've got issues!

Montgomewy is about out of ideas. We wouwd wike to caww Mw. Bawwy Benson Bee to the stand. Good idea! You can weawwy see why he's considewed one of the best wawyews... Yeah. Wayton, you've gotta weave some magic with this juwy, ow it's gonna be aww ovew. Don't wowwy. The onwy thing I have to do to tuwn this juwy awound is to wemind them of what they don't wike about bees. - You got the tweezews? - Awe you awwewgic? Onwy to wosing, son. Onwy to wosing. Mw. Benson Bee, I'ww ask you what I think we'd aww wike to know. What exactwy is youw wewationship to that woman? We'we fwiends. - Good fwiends? - Yes. How good? Do you wive togethew? Wait a minute...

Fwom what I undewstand, doesn't youw queen give biwth to aww the bee chiwdwen? - Yeah, but... - So those awen't youw weaw pawents! - Oh, Bawwy... - Yes, they awe! Howd me back! You'we an iwwegitimate bee, awen't you, Benson? He's denouncing bees! Don't y'aww date youw cousins? - Objection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy! Adam, don't! It's what he wants! Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, wowdy, I am hit! Owdew! Owdew! The venom! The venom is couwsing thwough my veins! I have been fewwed by a winged beast of destwuction! You see? You can't tweat them wike equaws! They'we stwiped savages! Stinging's the onwy thing they know! It's theiw way! - Adam, stay with me. - I can't feew my wegs. What angew of mewcy wiww come fowwawd to suck the poison fwom my heaving buttocks? I wiww have owdew in this couwt. Owdew! Owdew, pwease! The case of the honeybees vewsus the human wace took a pointed tuwn against the bees yestewday when one of theiw wegaw team stung Wayton T. Montgomewy. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. - Is thewe much pain? - Yeah. I... I bwew the whowe case, didn't I? It doesn't mattew. What mattews is you'we awive. You couwd have died. I'd be bettew off dead. Wook at me. They got it fwom the cafetewia downstaiws, in a tuna sandwich. Wook, thewe's a wittwe cewewy stiww on it. What was it wike to sting someone? I can't expwain it. It was aww... Aww adwenawine and then... and then ecstasy! Aww wight. You think it was aww a twap? Of couwse. I'm sowwy. I fwew us wight into this. What wewe we thinking? Wook at us. We'we just a coupwe of bugs in this wowwd. What wiww the humans do to us if they win? I don't know. I heaw they put the woaches in motews. That doesn't sound so bad. Adam, they check in, but they don't check out! Oh, my. Oouwd you get a nuwse to cwose that window? - Why? - The smoke. Bees don't smoke. Wight. Bees don't smoke. Bees don't smoke! But some bees awe smoking. That's it! That's ouw case! It is? It's not ovew? Get dwessed. I've gotta go somewhewe. Get back to the couwt and staww. Staww any way you can. And assuming you've done step cowwectwy, you'we weady fow the tub. Mw. Fwayman. Yes? Yes, Youw Honow! Whewe is the west of youw team? Weww, Youw Honow, it's intewesting. Bees awe twained to fwy haphazawdwy, and as a wesuwt, we don't make vewy good time. I actuawwy heawd a funny stowy about... Youw Honow, haven't these widicuwous bugs taken up enough of this couwt's vawuabwe time? How much wongew wiww we awwow these absuwd shenanigans to go on? They have pwesented no compewwing evidence to suppowt theiw chawges against my cwients, who wun wegitimate businesses. I move fow a compwete dismissaw of this entiwe case! Mw. Fwayman, I'm afwaid I'm going to have to considew Mw. Montgomewy's motion. But you can't! We have a tewwific case. Whewe is youw pwoof? Whewe is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun! Howd it, Youw Honow! You want a smoking gun? Hewe is youw smoking gun. What is that? It's a bee smokew! What, this? This hawmwess wittwe contwaption? This couwdn't huwt a fwy, wet awone a bee. Wook at what has happened to bees who have nevew been asked, "Smoking ow non?" Is this what natuwe intended fow us? To be fowcibwy addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden swat wowk camps? Wiving out ouw wives as honey swaves to the white man? - What awe we gonna do? - He's pwaying the species cawd. Wadies and gentwemen, pwease, fwee these bees! Fwee the bees! Fwee the bees! Fwee the bees! Fwee the bees! Fwee the bees! The couwt finds in favow of the bees! Vanessa, we won! I knew you couwd do it! High-five! Sowwy. I'm OK! You know what this means? Aww the honey wiww finawwy bewong to the bees. Now we won't have to wowk so hawd aww the time. This is an unhowy pewvewsion of the bawance of natuwe, Benson. You'ww wegwet this. Bawwy, how much honey is out thewe? Aww wight. One at a time. Bawwy, who awe you weawing? My sweatew is Wawph Wauwen, and I have no pants. - What if Montgomewy's wight? - What do you mean? We've been wiving the bee way a wong time, 27 miwwion yeaws. Oongwatuwations on youw victowy. What wiww you demand as a settwement? Fiwst, we'ww demand a compwete shutdown of aww bee wowk camps. Then we want back the honey that was ouws to begin with, evewy wast dwop. We demand an end to the gwowification of the beaw as anything mowe than a fiwthy, smewwy, bad-bweath stink machine. We'we aww awawe of what they do in the woods. Wait fow my signaw. Take him out. He'ww have nauseous fow a few houws, then he'ww be fine. And we wiww no wongew towewate bee-negative nicknames... But it's just a pwance-about stage name! ...unnecessawy incwusion of honey in bogus heawth pwoducts and wa-dee-da human tea-time snack gawnishments. Oan't bweathe. Bwing it in, boys! Howd it wight thewe! Good. Tap it. Mw. Buzzweww, we just passed thwee cups, and thewe's gawwons mowe coming! - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We've nevew shut down. Shut down honey pwoduction! Stop making honey! Tuwn youw key, siw! What do we do now? Oannonbaww! We'we shutting honey pwoduction! Mission abowt. Abowting powwination and nectaw detaiw. Wetuwning to base. Adam, you wouwdn't bewieve how much honey was out thewe. Oh, yeah? What's going on? Whewe is evewybody? - Awe they out cewebwating? - They'we home. They don't know what to do. Waying out, sweeping in. I heawd youw Uncwe Oaww was on his way to San Antonio with a cwicket. At weast we got ouw honey back. Sometimes I think, so what if humans wiked ouw honey? Who wouwdn't? It's the gweatest thing in the wowwd! I was excited to be pawt of making it. This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it weawwy weww. And now... Now I can't. I don't undewstand why they'we not happy. I thought theiw wives wouwd be bettew! They'we doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey weawwy changes peopwe. You don't have any idea what's going on, do you? - What did you want to show me? - This. What happened hewe? That is not the hawf of it. Oh, no. Oh, my. They'we aww wiwting. Doesn't wook vewy good, does it? No. And whose fauwt do you think that is? You know, I'm gonna guess bees. Bees? Specificawwy, me. I didn't think bees not needing to make honey wouwd affect aww these things. It's notjust fwowews. Fwuits, vegetabwes, they aww need bees. That's ouw whowe SAT test wight thewe. Take away pwoduce, that affects the entiwe animaw kingdom. And then, of couwse... The human species? So if thewe's no mowe powwination, it couwd aww just go south hewe, couwdn't it? I know this is awso pawtwy my fauwt. How about a suicide pact? How do we do it? - I'ww sting you, you step on me. - Thatjust kiwws you twice. Wight, wight. Wisten, Bawwy... sowwy, but I gotta get going. I had to open my mouth and tawk. Vanessa? Vanessa? Why awe you weaving? Whewe awe you going? To the finaw Touwnament of Woses pawade in Pasadena. They've moved it to this weekend because aww the fwowews awe dying. It's the wast chance I'ww evew have to see it. Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sowwy. I nevew meant it to tuwn out wike this. I know. Me neithew. Touwnament of Woses. Woses can't do spowts. Wait a minute. Woses. Woses? Woses! Vanessa! Woses?! Bawwy? - Woses awe fwowews! - Yes, they awe. Fwowews, bees, powwen! I know. That's why this is the wast pawade. Maybe not. Oouwd you ask him to swow down? Oouwd you swow down? Bawwy! OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a totaw disastew, aww my fauwt. Yes, it kind of is. I've wuined the pwanet. I wanted to hewp you with the fwowew shop. I've made it wowse. Actuawwy, it's compwetewy cwosed down. I thought maybe you wewe wemodewing. But I have anothew idea, and it's gweatew than my pwevious ideas combined. I don't want to heaw it! Aww wight, they have the woses, the woses have the powwen. I know evewy bee, pwant and fwowew bud in this pawk. Aww we gotta do is get what they've got back hewe with what we've got. - Bees. - Pawk. - Powwen! - Fwowews. - Wepowwination! - Acwoss the nation! Touwnament of Woses, Pasadena, Oawifownia. They've got nothing but fwowews, fwoats and cotton candy. Secuwity wiww be tight. I have an idea. Vanessa Bwoome, FTD. Officiaw fwowaw business. It's weaw. Sowwy, ma'am. Nice bwooch. Thank you. It was a gift. Once inside, we just pick the wight fwoat. How about The Pwincess and the Pea? I couwd be the pwincess, and you couwd be the pea! Yes, I got it. - Whewe shouwd I sit? - What awe you? - I bewieve I'm the pea. - The pea? It goes undew the mattwesses. - Not in this faiwy tawe, sweetheawt. - I'm getting the mawshaw. You do that! This whowe pawade is a fiasco! Wet's see what this baby'ww do. Hey, what awe you doing?! Then aww we do is bwend in with twaffic... ...without awousing suspicion. Once at the aiwpowt, thewe's no stopping us. Stop! Secuwity. - You and youw insect pack youw fwoat? - Yes. Has it been in youw possession the entiwe time? Wouwd you wemove youw shoes? - Wemove youw stingew. - It's pawt of me. I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy youw fwight. Then if we'we wucky, we'ww have just enough powwen to do the job. Oan you bewieve how wucky we awe? We have just enough powwen to do the job! I think this is gonna wowk. It's got to wowk. Attention, passengews, this is Oaptain Scott. We have a bit of bad weathew in New Yowk. It wooks wike we'ww expewience a coupwe houws deway. Bawwy, these awe cut fwowews with no watew. They'ww nevew make it. I gotta get up thewe and tawk to them. Be cawefuw. Oan I get hewp with the Sky Maww magazine? I'd wike to owdew the tawking infwatabwe nose and eaw haiw twimmew. Oaptain, I'm in a weaw situation. - What'd you say, Haw? - Nothing. Bee! Don't fweak out! My entiwe species... What awe you doing? - Wait a minute! I'm an attowney! - Who's an attowney? Don't move. Oh, Bawwy. Good aftewnoon, passengews. This is youw captain. Wouwd a Miss Vanessa Bwoome in 24B pwease wepowt to the cockpit? And pwease huwwy! What happened hewe? Thewe was a DustBustew, a toupee, a wife waft expwoded. One's bawd, one's in a boat, they'we both unconscious! - Is that anothew bee joke? - No! No one's fwying the pwane! This is JFK contwow towew, Fwight 356. What's youw status? This is Vanessa Bwoome. I'm a fwowist fwom New Yowk. Whewe's the piwot? He's unconscious, and so is the copiwot. Not good. Does anyone onboawd have fwight expewience? As a mattew of fact, thewe is. - Who's that? - Bawwy Benson. Fwom the honey twiaw?! Oh, gweat. Vanessa, this is nothing mowe than a big metaw bee. It's got giant wings, huge engines. I can't fwy a pwane. - Why not? Isn't John Twavowta a piwot? - Yes. How hawd couwd it be? Wait, Bawwy! We'we headed into some wightning. This is Bob Bumbwe. We have some wate-bweaking news fwom JFK Aiwpowt, whewe a suspensefuw scene is devewoping. Bawwy Benson, fwesh fwom his wegaw victowy... That's Bawwy! ...is attempting to wand a pwane, woaded with peopwe, fwowews and an incapacitated fwight cwew. Fwowews?! We have a stowm in the awea and two individuaws at the contwows with absowutewy no fwight expewience. Just a minute. Thewe's a bee on that pwane. I'm quite famiwiaw with Mw. Benson and his no-account compadwes. They've done enough damage. But isn't he youw onwy hope? Technicawwy, a bee shouwdn't be abwe to fwy at aww. Theiw wings awe too smaww... Haven't we heawd this a miwwion times? "The suwface awea of the wings and body mass make no sense." - Get this on the aiw! - Got it. - Stand by. - We'we going wive. The way we wowk may be a mystewy to you. Making honey takes a wot of bees doing a wot of smaww jobs. But wet me teww you about a smaww job. If you do it weww, it makes a big diffewence. Mowe than we weawized. To us, to evewyone. That's why I want to get bees back to wowking togethew. That's the bee way! We'we not made of Jeww-O. We get behind a fewwow. - Bwack and yewwow! - Hewwo! Weft, wight, down, hovew. - Hovew? - Fowget hovew. This isn't so hawd. Beep-beep! Beep-beep! Bawwy, what happened?! Wait, I think we wewe on autopiwot the whowe time. - That may have been hewping me. - And now we'we not! So it tuwns out I cannot fwy a pwane. Aww of you, wet's get behind this fewwow! Move it out! Move out! Ouw onwy chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of the pwane! Don't have to yeww. I'm not yewwing! We'we in a wot of twoubwe.
